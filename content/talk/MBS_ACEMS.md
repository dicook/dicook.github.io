being generated in huge quantities. Our mobile phone is continuously
broadcasting our location details; our household smart meter reports
our electronic footprint in 30 minute chunks. Using your credit card
can generate an ad appearing in your Facebook stream. But it is possible to access both your own data, and the data of your environment. Armed with an ability to create statistical ‘plots’ of your data, you can make sense of the world around you."
