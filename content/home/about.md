Hi! Thanks for visiting my web site. If you find anything useful, please tell me. If you would suggest improvements, please make an issue on the [github repo](https://github.com/dicook/dicook.github.io).

> Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in
Melbourne, Australia.  Her research is in the area of data visualisation, especially the visualisation of high-dimensional data using [tours](https://github.com/ggobi/tourr) with low-dimensional projections, and projection pursuit. A current focus is on bridging the gap between [exploratory graphics and statistical inference](http://dicook.github.io/nullabor/).  Technology plays an important role in data visualisation for evaluating effectiveness and for public consumption. Di utilises technology such as virtual environments, Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and eye-tracking in her work, and makes an effort to share her work with open source software.  Di is a Fellow of the [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org), elected member of the [International Statistical Institute](https://isi-web.org), past-editor of the [Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/toc/ucgs20/current), elected Member of the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/), and current editor of the [R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org). Education is an important part of her contributions, and mentoring graduate research is a significant activity. Several of her students have won the prestigious American Statistical Association John Chambers Software Award, including Hadley Wickham, Yihui Xie, Carson Sievert, and most recently, Monash student Earo Wang.

<small>*Note:* Di was a professor at Iowa State University from 1993-2015. She is listed as emeritus on that faculty web site and on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Cook_(statistician)). This status was only requested because this made it possible to continue to supervise her graduate students after the move to Monash. *She is not retired!* Iowa State University has an amazingly long history of statistics research, and the department is broadly connected to other departments on campus, with an active and supported consulting mission, in parallel to core research. This rich environment led to successfully fostering statistical graphics research, which continues to have a very active group of faculty and students.</small>
