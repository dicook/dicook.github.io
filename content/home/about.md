# Biography

Hello! Thanks for visiting my web site. If you find anything useful, please let me know. If you would suggest improvements, please do.

I do research in data visualisation, with a statistical focus. This includes visualising high-dimensional spaces using tours with low-dimensional projections, see the [tourr](https://github.com/ggobi/tourr). *Yes, you can see beyond 3D.*  My recent work sets up a framework to bridge the long-standing gap between exploratory and confirmatory statistics, with the essential ingredient being to consider a data plot as a statistic, like the mean is a statistic. Thinking about data plots using a grammar of graphics makes this possible. The R package [nullabor](http://dicook.github.io/nullabor/) has functions for conducting inference with plots. Technology plays an important role in data visualisation for evaluating effectiveness and for public consumption. I have experimented with virtual environments, Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and eye-tracking. Some of my past software projects are xgobi, ggobi, cranvas and a number of R packages. Mostly, I am curious about our world and use data plots to understand what is happening around me.

I am a Fellow of the [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org),  elected Ordinary Member of the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/), and past editor of the [Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/toc/ucgs20/current).
