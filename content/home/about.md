# Biography

I am a Fellow of the [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org),  elected Ordinary Member of the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/), and current editor of the [Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/toc/ucgs20/current). My primary research focuses on data visualisation, high-dimensional using tours of projections, and bridging the gap between exploratory and confirmatory statistics by treating the plot as a statistic. I have experimented with virtual environments, doing visual perception experiments using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and eye-tracking. Software development includes xgobi, ggobi, cranvas and a number of R packages. I am most happy when working on applying methods to problems, and this has included backhoes, drug studies, mud crab growth, climate change, gene expression analysis, butterfly populations in Yellowstone, stimulus funds spending, NRC rankings of graduate programs, technology boom and bust, election polls, soybean breeding, common crop population structures, insect gall to plant host interactions, Melbourne pedestrian traffic sensors, soccer and tennis statistics.
