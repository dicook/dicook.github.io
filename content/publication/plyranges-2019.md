abstract = "There is a cognitive load placed on users in learning a data abstraction from the Bioconductor project and understanding its appropriate use. Users must navigate these abstractions to perform a genomic analysis task, when a single data abstraction, a GRanges object will suffice. By recognizing that the GRanges class follows tidy data principles, we create a grammar of genomic data transformation, defining verbs for performing actions on and between genomic interval data and providing a way of performing common data analysis tasks through a coherent interface to existing Bioconductor infrastructure. We implement this grammar as a Bioconductor/R package called plyranges."
