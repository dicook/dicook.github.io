                Most of the money is being delivered to locations inside the USA. But it might be surprising to see that some money is making its way overseas to places like <i>Australia, China, Germany, France, Guam, Cameroon, </i>and <i>the Mariana Islands</i>.

	         There seem to be three types of funding that goes overseas:
	        <ul>
		  <li> <b>Infrastructure development</b> activities such as building, education and health in locations like <i>Guam, Mariana Islands</i> and <i>Virgin Islands</i>, where large amounts of funds are distributed broadly.
		  <li> <b>Academic collaborations</b> where small amounts are distributed to universities.
		  <li> <b>Industrial or military applications</b> where large amounts are given to corporations involved in medical research or geoscience endeavors.
                </ul>
		<p> There is also a small amount of funding seems to go specifically to some third world locations for health activities.
