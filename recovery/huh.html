                 <h1>Huh?</h1>
          <h2> These are some of the strange things that we have discovered about the data, <br>which are probably errors in the data recording.</h2>

            </div>

            <div class="left" style="height: 400px;">
	      <ul>
                <li>Alabama is a foreign country</li>
                <li>23 of the 81167 records for prime recipients are duplicates, and 2 award keys have multiple entries with different amounts. About 600 sub-recipient awards do not have an associated prime award key.</li>
                <li>About 400 awards are recorded to have been given prior to 2009. </li>
                <li>321 prime recipients are listed to have latitude=0 and longitude=0.</li>
		<li> A total of $183 billion of prime recipient awards is recorded in the data file for 2009, a little less than the $187 bilion allocated. This could simply be the missing award amount information for some records. </li>
		</div>
		<div class="right" style="width: 300px; padding-top:27px;">
		<li> 49 records have an award date prior to 2008. These total $44 million. These awards for a huge variety of purposes, including schools, building, wildlife organizations, zoos, roofing contractors!
		<li> Geographic locations are messed up for many overseas awards. For example, the six awards to Australian organizations are listed as being at 48.2N, 16.3E which is in Austria (yes, Europe), and awards to American Samoa are listed as being 35.3S, 149.0E which is Canberra, Australia. Similarly Switzerland and China are confused. Probably the person who entered the lat/longs was confused about the two letter country code.
