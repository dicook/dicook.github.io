  <li>	<h3> <a href="http://dicook.github.io/BusinessAnalyticsCourse/">ETC3250 - Business Analytics</a> </h3>
		<p>
		Business analytics involves uncovering the hidden information in masses of business data using statistical models and algorithms. In this unit, some of the most widely used prediction and classification models will be covered. A suitable software environment for business analytics will be used, and tools for handling large data sets will be introduced.
                </p>
                <p>
We will explore the trade-off and distinction between prediction, explanation and interpretation using statistical models. Topics to be covered include numerical optimisation; Monte Carlo simulation; resampling methods such as the bootstrap, cross-validation, and bagging; nonlinear and nonparametric methods such as regression splines, trees and support vector machines; principal components analysis and clustering.

  <li> <h3>Stat/Engl 332 - Visual Communication of Quantitative Information </h3>
		<p>
		This course will help prepare students to be active citizens in the information technology age. Students will develop critical thinking skills about how information is visually presented, and they will learn how to accurately and attractively communicate quantitative information using graphics. At the end of the course students will: (1) know about important historical and contemporary examples, (2) know about and how to implement the elements of graphical design, (3) be able to evaluate visual presentations of information in the media, and, (4) be able to use the computer to generate graphics to communicate information effectively
