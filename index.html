		<p> I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. My research is in data visualization, exploratory data analysis, multivariate methods, data mining and statistical computing. I have experimented with visualizing data in virtual environments, participated in producing software including xgobi, ggobi, cranvas and several R packages. Methods development include tours, projection pursuit, manual controls for tours, pipelines for interactive graphics, a grammar of graphics for biological data, and visualizing boundaries in high-d classifiers.  My current work is focusing on bridging the gap between statistical inference and exploratory graphics. We are doing experiments using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and eye-tracking equipment. Some of the applications that I have worked on include backhoes, drug studies, mud crab growth, climate change, gene expression analysis, butterfly populations in Yellowstone, stimulus funds spending, NRC rankings of graduate programs, technology boom and bust, election polls, soybean breeding, common crop population structures, insect gall to plant host interactions, soccer and tennis statistics.
