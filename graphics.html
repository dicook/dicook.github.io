<ul>
  <li>	9/3/2014 Carson Sievert <em> <a href="http://cpsievert.github.io/slides/animint/" target="_blank"> Producing interactive animations with animint </a>  </em> A google summer of code project work mentored by <a href="https://github.com/tdhock">Toby Hocking</a>.
 </li>
  <li> 9/10/2014 Ian Lyttle, Alex Shum <em> <a href="https://ijlyttle.shinyapps.io/isugg_ggvis_shiny/" target="_blank"> Summertime with ggvis and shiny </a> </em> A summer internship at <a href="http://www.schneider-electric.com/us/en/">Schneider-Electric</a> in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
 </li>
 <li> 9/17/2014 Di Cook, with Luke Fostveldt, Alex Shum and Ian Lyttle 
 <em> <a href="wg/Cook-slides.html" target="_blank"> Seven Things That Affect Education Around the World</a> </em> The talk describes the visualizations produced for the <a href="http://beta.icm.edu.pl/PISAcontest/"> OECD data challenge</a> at useR! 2014. </li>
 <li> 9/24/2014 Sam Tyner 
 <em> <a href="">My summer internship with Kingland Systems</a> </em> How I analyzed data while preparing for the PhD prelim. </li>
  <li> 10/1/2014 Heike Hofmann, Lendie Follett and Adam Loy 
 <em> <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~hofmann/talks/qq-plot.pdf" target="_blank"> Q-Q plots - the power of our eyes </a> </em> A description of an experiment exploring how people read Q-Q plots, should they be rotated to be viewed in comparison to a horizontal line, and how they compare with classical tests.  </li>
 <li> 10/8/2014 Xiaoyue Cheng <em> <a href="http://xycheng.public.iastate.edu/talks/cartogram10082014.html" target="_blank">Visualize areal data via cartograms </a></em> Cartograms provide a way to show geographic data where areas match the value they portray, but the geography is still recognizable. I will discuss implementing the <a href="https://github.com/chxy/cartogram">algorithms into R</a>.
 <li> 10/15/2014 Eric Hare and Andee Kaplan <em> <a href"http://andeekaplan.com/presentations/isu-graphics/data_with_friends/part_1.html"> Data analysis with friends</a> using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Digital Oceans</a></em> This is part one of a two part seminar for the ISU graphics working group. In this talk we will discuss a new tool for collaborative data analysis developed by Project Jupyter - CoLaboratory. We will give some background information on the tool, and then spend the majority of the session walking through installation with the group. In Part 2 (Oct. 29) we will perform a group data analysis real-time in the ISU graphics working group using CoLaboratory. </li>
 <li> 10/22/2014 Eun-kyung Lee, Visiting associate professor from EWHA <em> <a href=""> Visual model validation in pharmacometrics </a> </em> Phase I clinical trial is the very important step in the new drug development procedure. The population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model is used to figure out the kinetic properties of new drug compound in phase I clinical trial. The ultimate goal is to select an appropriate dosing regimen, optimize further clinical trial design, and make informed go/no-go decisions. This modelling procedure needs to be carefully validated. In this talk, I'll introduce various graphical model validation methods in the pharmacometrics. </li>
