# ~~You can't see beyond 3D!~~

We are going to see that this is not true, and why it is useful to visualise high dimensions

[Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (1884) Edwin Abbott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland) 

The story describes a 2D world (Flatland) occupied by geometric figures, where .orange[women are simple line-segments], and .orange[men are polygons with various numbers of sides].

The narrator is a Square, who guides the readers through some of the implications of life in 2D (Flatland). The Square dreams about a visit to a 1D world (Lineland) inhabited by "lustrous points", where he .orange[can only be seen as a set of points]. The Square attempts to convince the realm's monarch of a second dimension. 

He is himself visited by a 3D sphere! The Sphere from Spaceland levitates up and down, allowing Square to .orange[see the circle expand and contract] (this would actually be a .orange[slice] rather than a .orange[projection]).

# High-dimensions in statistics

&lt;img src="img/cubes.png" width="100%"&gt;

Increasing dimension adds an additional orthogonal axis. 

If you want more high-dimensional shapes there is an R package, [geozoo](http://schloerke.com/geozoo/all/), which will generate cubes, spheres, simplices, mobius strips, torii, boy surface, klein bottles, cones, various polytopes, ...

# Making a tour

`\({\mathbf x}_i \in \mathcal{R}^p\)`, `\(i^{th}\)` row of an `\({\mathbf X}_{n\times p}\)` data matrix.

`\(F\)` is a `\(p\times d\)` orthonormal basis, `\(F'F=I_d\)`, where `\(d\)` is the projection dimension.

The projection of `\({\mathbf x_i}\)` onto `\(F\)` is `\({\mathbf y}_i={\mathbf x}_iF\)`, or of the full data matrix as `\({\mathbf Y}_{n\times d} = {\mathbf XF}\)`.


]

.right-plot[

Tour is indexed by time, `\(F(t)\)`, where `\(t\in [a, z]\)`. Starting and target frame denoted as `\(F_a = F(a), F_z=F(t)\)`.

- Examine .orange[differences] between classes
- Determine .orange[important variables], which would contribute most to a classification
- Detect .orange[outliers], or unusual observations, that might contaminate model fitting
- Assess and compare classification .orange[models]

# Nonlinear vs linear dimension reduction 

The main purpose of [liminal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/liminal/index.html) is to link nonlinear dimension reductions, using methods such as tSNE or UMAP or PHATE or MDS, with tour views. 

Nonlinear dimension reduction is very popular, but can be tricky to calibrate and tune. .orange[What does the mapping do to the structure]?

# Thanks for listening!

Here's what I hope you take away from this talk:

- it is possible to see beyond 3D
- there are new ways for touring using slices and sage transformations
- stay tuned for new approaches for searching for shape differences between groups, and for slicing to explore/compare classifiers
- statistics is better if we keep our eyes involved.
