2. Each observation is a row
3. Each value is a cell

# A statistic is a function of the data

For example, the sample mean,

`$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$$` 

and standard deviation,

`$$s_{X}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-\bar{X})^2}$$`

# Now we can start doing statistics with plots, actually statistical inference

---

# Population and sample

Inference happens when you have information on a .orange[subset of data], and you want to make statements about the .orange[full set]. Typically, inference is done using the .orange[sample statistics], and what we know about the .orange[behaviour of that statistic] over all possible subsets, of the same size.

Typically, inference is done using the .orange[sample statistics], and what we know about the .orange[behaviour of that statistic] over all possible subsets, of the same size.

![](img/sample2.png)

Sample again

---
# Population parameters

If we assume that the .orange[population can be described by a distribution], characterized by parameters such as the population mean, `\(\mu\)`

and standard deviation, `\(\sigma\)`, e.g. the bell curve,

`$$N(\mu, \sigma)$$`

then the sample statistic behaves nicely, close to the population mean, and closer still when the sample size, `\(n\)` is large. This is parametric statistics. 


---
# Non-parametric

If we .orange[don't want to assume the population has a known distribution], but we'd still like to be able to say something about the population based on the sample at hand, we can use methods like .orange[**bootstrap**] to sample the sample with replacement, or .orange[**permutation**] to break associations between variables. 

The behaviour of the statistic over the bootstrap samples can give us information about the analogous population quantity. And the behaviour of the statistic over permutations shows us what we might expect if there really is no association.

*Below is a simple scatterplot of the two variables of interest. A slight negative slope is observed, but it does not look very large. There are a lot of states whose capitals are less than 5% of the total population. The two outliers are Hawaii (government rank 33 and capital population 25%) and Arizona (government rank 26 and capital population 23%). Without those two the downward trend (an improvement in ranking) would be much stronger.*

*I ran linear regressions of government rank on the percentage of each state’s population living in the capital city, state population (in 100,000s), and state GDP (in $100,000s).... The .orange[coefficient is not significant] for any regression at the traditional 5% level.*

# Summary

- Tidy data provides the glue from raw data to the data in the statistics textbooks 
    - it fills that vast chasm that has existed and exasperated for eons.
    - No longer do statisticians have to request the clean tabular format csv file before they can get started
    
---
# Summary
    
- The grammar of graphics provides the functional mapping of variable to plot element that makes data plots become statistics that we can do inference on
    - Visual inference protocol gives some teeth to the discoveries 
    - ... and helps to avoid apophenia
    - Prevents *p*-hacking and supports practical significance
- Think about interactive graphics and inference procedures as part of the data pipeline
