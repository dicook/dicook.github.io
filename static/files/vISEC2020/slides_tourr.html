# Getting set up

---
# `tourr` 

.left-code[


```r
install.packages("tourr")
help(package="tourr")
```
]

.right-plot[


```r
library("tourr")
```

Implements geodesic interpolation and basis
    generation functions that allow you to create new tour
    methods from R.
]
---
# `spinifex`

.left-code[


```r
install.packages("spinifex")
help(package="spinifex")
```
]

.right-plot[


```r
library("spinifex")
```

Implements  manual control, where the contribution of a selected variable can be adjusted between -1 to 1, to examine the sensitivity of structure in the data to that variable.  The result is an animation where the variable is toured into and out of the projection completely.
]

# `geozoo`

.left-code[


```r
install.packages("geozoo")
help(package="geozoo")
```
]

.right-plot[


```r
library("geozoo")
```

Geometric objects defined in 'geozoo' can be simulated or displayed in the R package 'tourr'.

# What is a tour?

A grand tour is by definition a movie of low-dimensional projections constructed in such a way that it comes arbitrarily close to showing all possible low-dimensional projections; in other words, a grand tour is a space-filling curve in the manifold of low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional data spaces.
]

.right-plot[
`\({\mathbf x}_i \in \mathcal{R}^p\)`, `\(i^{th}\)` data vector

`\(F\)` is a `\(p\times d\)` orthonormal basis, `\(F'F=I_d\)`, where `\(d\)` is the projection dimension.

The projection of `\({\mathbf x_i}\)` onto `\(F\)` is `\({\mathbf y}_i=F'{\mathbf x}_i\)`.

Tour is indexed by time, `\(F(t)\)`, where `\(t\in [a, z]\)`. Starting and target frame denoted as `\(F_a = F(a), F_z=F(t)\)`.

The animation of the projected data is given by a path `\({\mathbf y}_i(t)=F'(t){\mathbf x}_i\)`.

There may be multiple and different combinations of variables that reveal similar structure. ☹️ 

The tour can help to discover these, too. 😂 

---
# Other tour types

- .orange[guided]: follows the optimisation path for a projection pursuit index.
- .orange[little]: interpolates between all variables. 
- .orange[local]: rocks back and forth from a given projection, so shows all possible projections within a radius.
- .orange[dependence]: two independent 1D tours
- .orange[frozen]: fixes some variable coefficients, others vary freely. 
- .orange[manual]: control coefficient of one variable, to examine the sensitivity of structure this variable. (In the .orange[spinifex] package)
- .orange[slice]: use a section instead of a projection.

.font_small[
- `holes`: This is an inverse Gaussian filter, which is optimised when there is not much data in the center of the projection, i.e. a "hole" or donut shape in 2D.
- `central mass`: The opposite of holes, high density in the centre of the projection, and often "outliers" on the edges. 
- `LDA`/`PDA`: An index based on the linear discriminant dimension reduction (and penalised), optimised by projections where the named classes are most separated.

# How do I use tours

---


- Classification: 
    - to check assumptions of models
    - to examine separations between groups
    - determine variable importance
    - examine boundaries 
    - random forest diagnostics vote matrix
- Dimension reduction
    - go beyond 2 PCs
    - work with much higher dimensional data
    - check for not linear dependencies

---

- Clustering
    - examine shape of clusters
    - separation between clusters
    - compare cluster solution
    - view the dendrogram in data space
- Compositional data
    - shapes and clusters in a simplex

# Saving for publication

Method 1, using plotly (see `reading axes` code chunk):

1. Generate each frame, index each frame, a big array
2. Make one big ggplot, with all frames overplotted, and a non-used argument `frame` pointing to your index
3. Pass to `ggplotly` 
4. Save to html using `htmltools::save_html()` 

or try using 

```
spinifex::play_tour_path()
```

---
# Saving for publication

Method 1, using `gifski` and `tourr::render_gif()`. See lots of code chunks!

---
# Summary

We can learn a little more about the data if have a tour in the toolbox. It can help us to understand 

- dependencies between multiple variables
- examine shapes, of clusters
- detect outliers
